# TODO list

TODO: analyze_verify
* an analysis pass for verifying code for low-level soundness
TODO: analyze_loop
* an analysis pass for adding loop-metadata to basic blocks
TODO: analyze_side_effect
* an analysis pass for adding side-effect metadata to every instruction and function
TODO: optimize_alloca_elim
* an optimization pass that eliminates alloca's which only have a single store in the same basic block, or no store at all
